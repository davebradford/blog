# Hello I'm Dave

I'm a over thinking developer, in the last few years I've picked up a bit of design based mainly on frustration. I'm interested in how people use systems and how these could be improved.

I love my camera.

I have an unhealthy obsession with my nations capital city.

# To much information.

A few years ago I moved away from using a CMS, I'm proud to say this site is 100% statically generated using Jekyll and some custom ruby which I've learned along the years.

I use nginx to serve up the static files and my setup is wrapped in a [docker](http://docker.com/) container.

This site is fast in part by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=b35972924bb4) (affiliate link included) and their awesome VPS servers.
