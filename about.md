# Hello I'm Dave

I'm a over thinking developer.

I'm interested in how people use systems and how these could be improved.



# To much information.

A few years ago I moved away from using a CMS, I'm proud to say this site is 100% statically generated using Jekyll and some custom ruby which I've learned along the years.

I use Github pages to host this site.
