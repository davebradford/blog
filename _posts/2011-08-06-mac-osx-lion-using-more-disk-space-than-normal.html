<p>Since I upgraded my MacBook to Lion (Apple's new version of OSX) I've noticed a few days ago I've been loosing hard drive space
quite rapidly? After searching around the Apple community forums I noticed a few articles which pointed toward Time Machine backups,
turns out Lion will backup using the local disk if it cannot find it's dedicated drive, a little bit of a pain. Since I'm a laptop
user I find myself away from my external drives a fair bit.</p>

<p>There is a command you can use in the terminal to stop this from happening:</p>

<blockquote>sudo tmutil disablelocal</blockquote>

<p>This will completely stop Time Machine from using your local disk and return Â your drive usage back to normal. Running this command
gave me 2GB of space back after a restart. It looks like this only happens on Apple portable computers.</p>
