<p>A few weeks ago I was on the phone to tech support about a problematic server, the first question they asked me was, "Can we have the make and serial
number of your product please sir?", "ermm" I replied, I guess I could have taken a look on the box for the information, however this server was 70
miles away from where I was sitting. On a Mac OSX system you can find the serial number using "About My Mac", however on a Windows System this
requires a little more effort, but it is possible.</p>



<p>This prompted me to brush off some of my VBS scripting I'd learn at college and come up with a simple solution to this problem. The answer? A script
which will pop-up your make and model number as long as you can remote to the device. I've not found a problem with this script on any Windows system
yet, this script takes advantage of WMI services from the BIOS. If you want to have a play with VBS scripting I've found Microsoft MSDN a great
resource, you can extend this script to display more information, if you wish.</p>

<p>To get the script setup and working on your machine copy and paste the code listed below into a blank text file. Save this rename to something like
<em>serverinfo.vbs</em>, then all you will need to do is run this on the device which you need the information from, and you will will recieve a
series of popups. I was using this to dump to a text file but I found the popups easier when I need this information quickly, however this script
should have everything you need to get you started.</p>

<em>strComputer = "."</em>

<em>&amp; "{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\" &amp;
strComputer &amp; "\root\cimv2")</em>
<em>Set colBIOS = objWMIService.ExecQuery _</em>
<em>("Select * from Win32_BIOS")</em>
<em>For each objBIOS in colBIOS</em>
<em>Wscript.Echo "Got a pen ready? Make and Serial will follow."</em>
<em>Wscript.Echo objBIOS.Manufacturer</em>
<em>Wscript.Echo objBIOS.SerialNumber</em>
<em>Next</em>
