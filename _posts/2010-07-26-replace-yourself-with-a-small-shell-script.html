<p>A very geek post to start this week.</p>

<p>Hilary Mason is a computer science professor, a very interesting character. At IgniteNYC she gave a 5 minute talk on replacing yourself with a small
shell script to simplify your life.</p>

<p>She ponders the idea that boring e-mail tasks like follow ups should be automated, humans are humans, and we forget things. I love the idea that a
shell script can handle all the day to day functions we find so boring. Hilary is a true geek, please be warned, but she may be the next person to
make your life easier.</p>
