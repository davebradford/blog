<p>After some issues this weekend, I've was forced to troubleshoot a Mac. However, with Apples proprietary hardware and without the POST information
from a PC it can prove rather difficult.</p>

<p>So after a little late night Googling, this is what I found, a great little utility called AppleJack.</p>

<blockquote>AppleJack is a user friendly troubleshooting assistant for Mac OS X. With AppleJack you can troubleshoot a computer even if you can't
load the GUI, or don't have a startup CD handy. AppleJack runs in Single User Mode and is menu-based for ease of use.</blockquote>

<p>And my does this work! After installing you can after a restart <em>Command - S </em>and simply type <em>applejack </em>when you hit the command
line to reach the diagnostics menu. Just a few seconds to install is all you need and this may just save your bacon! Follow the link below for the
install guide and the AppleJack project page.</p>
