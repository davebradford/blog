<p>Jesus.. look at that title for a post! "10 days in a carry-on" sounds like I had to endure 10 days in someone's hand luggage if
that where the case then it would explain the lack of posts. 10 days in a carry on is a New York Times article I really wanted to
share.</p>

<p>It tells the story of Heather Poole, a flight attendant and how she manages to live out of her carry-on luggage for 10 days at a
time! Every time I go on holiday I do try to take less and less, try to make it to the end of the gallery it's amazing how she
manages to get all that stuff with a few simple techniques.</p>
