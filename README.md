Here is the code for my website written in Jekyll. There are a few customisations but other than that it's a pretty standard install.

  "pack light go fast"

Just clone this repo and run the following command to get this site up and running.

	jekyll server

Then visit a browser and have a look at http://localhost:4000/ to view the site.
